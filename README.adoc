This project is a link:https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter[cookiecutter] template. This template generates a skeleton Python app
-- specifically, an app that's meant to be invoked via the command line as a filter.
Where Filter means a program that accepts input via stdin, processes it in some way, 
and then sends that processed data along to stdout. 

*This template assumes Python 3.5 or above.*
