== Logging

Messages regarding how the data processing is going can be sent to two places: 
A succinct log is sent to the console (to `stderr` to be precise).
An optional detailed log can be written to a file on disk. 

Use the `--logfile` switch to specify the name of a log file to use. 

By default, the version of the log written to the console (`stderr`) excludes diagnostic and debugging messages.
Use the `--verbose`, `--debug`, or `--trace` switches to see more.
(`--debug` is very verbose. `--trace` is very, very verbose.)

Log messages sent to the console are colorized by default. 
The `--nocolor` switch turns this off.
Also, if `stderr` is redirected away from the console, then coloring is automatically turned off.

== Command Line Switches

* Use `--help` to get a summary of the switches available.
* Use `--version` to see what version of this tool is installed.
* Use `--infile` (or `-i`) to specify the name (and path) for the input (instead of `stdin`).
* Use `--outfile` (or `-o`) to specify the name (and path) for the output (instead of `stdout`).
* Use `--logfile` (or `-l`) to send a super-verbose log to a file.
* Use `--configfile` (or `-c`) to specify the name (and path) of a configuration file.
* Use `--verbose` (or `-v`), `--debug`, `--trace` to increase how much information is sent to the console.
* Use `--nocolor` if you don't like how messages sent to the console are colorized.
* Use `--devel` (or `-d`) to turn on "`development mode.`" 

== Configuration

An optional configuration file can be specified via the `--configfile` switch.
This file needs to be in standard INI file format.
