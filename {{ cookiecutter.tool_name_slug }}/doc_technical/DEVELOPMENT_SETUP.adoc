= Notes on Setting Up a Development Environment

== Installing the {{ cookiecutter.tool_name }} source code

See link:../doc/INSTALL.adoc[INSTALL]

== Installing Visual Studio Code (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux), if desired

Microsoft Visual Studio Code (we'll call it VSCode from now on) is a free IDE (integrated development environment) that runs on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

NOTE: "Visual Studio Code" is different than full-fledged "Visual Studio." 
VSCode is slimmed down. 
You can work on Python code in either, but VSCode is preferred.

NOTE: At some point after getting started, be sure to see our link:VSCODE_TIPS.adoc[VSCODE_TIPS]

Official documentation on editing Python with VSCode is at: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python. 
Here is a bare-bones summary:

. Install Python, if not already. (TIP: The Python installer defaults to placing it in your user-folder's appdata subfolder. You'll save yourself a world of hurt if you change it to something simpler, e.g. C:\Python38).
. Download VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/ and install.
. In the Welcome tab...
. Under Help, click on "Printable keyboard cheatsheet" and print it.
. Under Customize, click on "Tools and Languages"
. Select Python and click Install.
. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl-Shift-P) and type "py" to jump down to the Python commands. Scroll down to "Python: Select Interpreter" and hit enter. It will take a second to find all versions of Python installed on your machine. Select the one you want to use. (If there is only one, it will automatically select it for you.)
. Unit Testing for Python in VSCode is disabled by default. To enable testing, open the Command Palette and use "Python: Configure Tests". Select PyTest as the framework, then tell it that the unit tests are in the "tests" folder (not test_data).
. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl-Shift-P) and type "pref" to jump down to the preferences. Scroll down to "Preferences: Configure Language Specific Settings" and hit enter. Select Python. This will open your settings.json file and add a [Python] section. Start typing "indent" until editor.detectIndentation is selected. Hit enter. From now on, when you open a file in VSCode, it will scan to see if the file uses tabs or spaces and then continue in whatever style it finds.

== Using Visual Studio Code with {{ cookiecutter.tool_name }}

. To open the {{ cookiecutter.tool_name }} project, use File | Open Folder and select the root folder for the project (where you cloned it to).
. To run {{ cookiecutter.tool_name }}, select {{ cookiecutter.tool_name }}.py and click the run button on the left (Ctrl-Shift-D).
. The first time you open the Run view, it will suggest that you "create a launch.json file." Go ahead and click on that suggestion. Select Python, then select "Python: Current File." A tab will open up with a 14 line default configuration. Just save it as is and close the tab.
. To actually run the program, click on the green "play" button in the upper left.
. The first time you run a Python program, VSCode will prompt you to install Linter. Go ahead and install it.


== Running the Unit Tests

We use the new PyTest library for unit testing (not to be confused with PyUnit, the original unit testing library that's part of Python).

    pip install pytest

Running all of the unit tests from the command line:

    pytest 

Running a specific unit test from the command line:

    pytest tests/test_x.py

Running the unit tests from within Visual Studio Code (VSCode):

. (The VSCode install instructions above include how to configure it for PyTest.)
. Click on the flask icon (far left) to bring up the Test Explorer.
. Click on the green circular arrow (refresh) icon at the top to discover all of the tests.
. Click on the green double-play icon at the top to run all of the tests.
. Or, navigate to a particular test and click the green play icon to the right of it.

See the PyTest documentation for how to write the tests: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/


== Using the Debug Logs

This being a command-line filter type tool, all log messages (at any level from critical to info) are sent to stderr.
(Using --verbose adds any debug messages as well.)
Unless otherwise redirected (1>>), stderr streams to the console.
