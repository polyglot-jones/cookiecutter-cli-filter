== One-Time Setup Goals ==
    activate     -- Installs and activates the virtual environment.
    dev-env      -- Installs gwpycore and all other requirements, etc.
    qt-designer  -- Installs the QT-designer tool.

== Regular Goals ==
    test        -- Runs all of the unit tests.
    standardize -- Apply the linting tools (format, isort, and lint) to all of the .py files.
    dist        -- Build a distribution.
	rcc         -- Compile main_ui.qrc.
    clean       -- Deletes all temporary files.
    help        -- This list.

== Sub-Goals (can be executed explicitly, if desired) ==
    pip          -- Upgrade pip to the latest
    gwpycore     -- Clones the gwpycore source code and installs it (symlink-ish).
    requirements -- Ensures that all of the modules required by this project are installed (in the virtual env).
    format       -- Re-formats all of the Python code (with black).
    isort        -- Cleans up all of the imports (using isort).
    lint         -- Lints code (using flake8).
